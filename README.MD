# Plymouth Apterture Sience Logo

Display an Aperture Sience Logo, spin it and let it glow.

## Installation

You need `plymouth`, of course. Only tested under Ubuntu, with
`update-alternatives`.

Put the cloned repository in the themes-folder of plymouth to be sure it'll
work. You also need to be root.

1. Run `./install.sh` to generate/download the files.
2. Run `./apply.sh` to use it as the current bootscreen.
